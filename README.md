 In the index.html file, I created one container that holds 9 time blocks. They each have an id corresponding to the hour. 

 In the JS file. I targetted the id in the html file that says current day, and used the new Date method to show that on the page. I targetted the savBtn class and set up a click event that will grab the input values and save them to localStorage. Next I created the hourColorizer function to set the correct color on the text area that corresponds to the time of day. Gray is for past time, red is for present time, and green is set for all future time.
